# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Shareable province and fuel links and a price sharing button.
- Durable notification queue with independent FCM topic and Telegram delivery tracking.
- Frontend tests for sharing, data validation and notification subscription recovery.
- Windows and Linux collector checks, API documentation and contribution templates.

### Fixed
- Missing fuel prices and duplicate province rows no longer pass collector validation.
- Previously stored missing prices can recover without generating a false price alert.
- Failed notification requests no longer report success; unfinished deliveries are retried.
- First-load failures show a retry action; malformed local cache no longer blocks recovery.
- Old notification subscriptions remain available for cleanup after network errors.
- Telegram message line endings are consistent across Windows and Linux.

### Changed
- Describe scheduled checks accurately instead of promising instant alerts.
- Use lockfile-based installs in CI and web deployment.

This section is not a published release. Android distribution and a Chrome extension remain planned.
